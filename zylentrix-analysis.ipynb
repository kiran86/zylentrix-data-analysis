    "# Zylentrix Student Engagement Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Zylentrix runs an online training platform where students enrol in different learning tracks (e.g., Digital Marketing, Python, UI/UX, etc.). The platform\n",
    "records student behaviour, such as logins, course completions, time spent on lessons, and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The system captures data one student enrollment in different courses, their activity in different courses and feedback they give regarding different courses. Based on these system produce `.csv` files as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `students.csv` – Contains student info (ID, Name, Age, Gender, Location, Enrolment Date)\n",
    "2. `course_activity.csv` – Tracks user activity (Student ID, Course ID, Date, Time Spent [mins], Completion %)\n",
    "3. `feedback.csv` – Records feedback (Student ID, Course ID, Rating [1-5], Feedback Text)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare Data\n",
    "To begin with the analysis, first load the necessary libraries and then load the `.csv` files in data frames. For this analysis we will be using `pandas` library for data preparation, cleaning and transformation where needed."
